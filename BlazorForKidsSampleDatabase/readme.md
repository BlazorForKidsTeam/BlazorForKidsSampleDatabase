# BlazorForKids ‚Äì If Simple Feels Hard, It‚Äôs Not Really Simple

**BlazorForKids** is a development framework built on top of Blazor Server that helps you build web applications **faster, easier, and without unnecessary complexity**.

Whether you're learning Blazor, building your first app, or prototyping a new idea, BlazorForKids gives you a clean, structured starting point‚Äîso you can focus on what really matters: your logic and your features.

## ‚ú® Why BlazorForKids?

Modern development should be **simple by design**, not just in theory. BlazorForKids does the heavy lifting for you by using **source generators** that create repetitive code automatically.

That means:
- No more boilerplate
- No need to wire up the same logic again and again
- More time spent building features, not infrastructure

## üîß Project Structure

BlazorForKids is delivered as a **solution template** with two key projects, each powered by a dedicated SDK:

### üì¶ Domain Project ‚Äì `BlazorForKids.Sdk.Domain`

- Clean architecture for your **backend logic**
- Built-in support for **Entity Framework Core**
- Automatic generation of **data models** and **business rules**
- Focused on **data access** and **domain logic**

### üåê Web Project ‚Äì `BlazorForKids.Sdk.Web`
